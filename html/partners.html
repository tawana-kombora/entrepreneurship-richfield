                <p>In the current economic situation, it becomes mandatory for institutions to increase their networking opportunities through affiliations and partnerships. When partnerships are implemented correctly, the private sector can increase efficiency and choice, and expand access to education services, particularly for households that tend to be poorly served by traditional delivery methods.</p>
